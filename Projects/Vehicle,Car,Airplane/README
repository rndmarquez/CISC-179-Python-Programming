A- Define a class called Vehicle as follows:

The Vehicle class has two instance variables:
name,
max_speed
Define an __init__ function for the Vehicle class that initializes the name and max_speed instance variables
Define get and set methods for each of the name and max_speed variables. You may call them getName, getMax_speed, setName and setMax_speed
Define a __str__ function that prints the name and max_speed of the Vehicle class.
B- Define a class called Car as follows:

The Car class is a subclass of the Vehicle class.
The Car class has an instance variable called number_of_cylinders
Define an __init__ function for the Car class that initializes the name and max_speed and number_of_cylinders instance variables
Please note that the Car class inherits the name and max_speed variables from the Vehicle class and does not redefine them.
Define get and set methods for the number_of_cylinders variable.
Define a __str__ function that prints the name and max_speed and number_of_cylinders of the Car class.
C- Define a class called Airplane as follows:

The Airplane class is a subclass of the Vehicle class.
The Airplane class has an instance variable called number_of_engines
Define an __init__ function for the Airplane class that initializes the name and max_speed and number_of_engines instance variables
Please note that the Airplane class inherits the name and max_speed variables from the Vehicle class and does not redefine them.
Define get and set methods for the number_of_engines variable.
Define a __str__ function that prints the name and max_speed and number_of_engines of the Airplane class.
D- Define a function that performs the following:

Creates an instance of a Car class and an instance of an Airplane class.
You may call them myCar and myAirplane and choose values for their name, speed, number_of_cylinders, and number_of_engines instance variables
Call all the get methods that are accessible to the myCar and myAirplane instances and print the returned value.
Please note that the get methods of the Vehicle super class is available to the Car and Airplane sub classes.
Increase the max_speed value of the myCar by 50 miles and increase the max_speed value of the myAirplane by 100 miles, by calling their setName and setMax_speed functions.
print both myCar and myAirplane objects.
Compare the max_speeds of myCar and myAirplane objects and print which one is faster.
